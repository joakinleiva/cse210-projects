For me, version control is a tool to helps us analyze, test and improve our code through time.

One of its benefits is that it helps us control and know who did what on a
team or project.

To illustrate this concept, I will use the example of an events programming team
at a Video Game Company. The ones in charge of programming the events after, 
for example, a gun makes a shot, can add some extra features after testing the
shot functions. For example, if another player gets shot, they just die. After 
a team meeting, the team concluded that the player killed could have
been carrying some equipment (guns, health, etc). So, after some changes in the
classes and code the player who gets shot still dies, but now the equipment that
he or she was carrying appears on the floor, for someone else to pick them.

This tool mostly uses a terminal and commands to work with. One of those is
git command push, which allows syncing both local and online repositories.
